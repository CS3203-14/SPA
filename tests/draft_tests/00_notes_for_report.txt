10: Most of the basic queries are covered with this source. The idea is to reuse the queries for the different SIMPLE source, while updating the expected results
======================================================================================
110: One Synonym, No Clauses: Emphasis on Synonym format and Design Entities
======================================================================================
- test for retrieval of all design entities, i.e assign, variables, print, read, procedure, etc
- test for valid and invalid synonyms
======================================================================================
111: One Synonym, One Clauses - Valid
======================================================================================
=============================================
Testing Follows and Follows* select clause (1-16)
=============================================
- Follows* query created for all indentation levels (1 - 5)
- Follows query created for all statements at the first level indentation (6 - 12)
* The reason why Follows is only done for one level of indentation is because if all Follows* query are successful, all indentation level for Follows query should also be successful
- Follows(_,_) and Follows*(_,_) created to test for all statements (13-14)
- Testing select clause for other design entities and different nesting levels (15-16)
=============================================
Testing Parent and Parent* select clause (17 - 26)
=============================================
- Parent query created for all while loops (17-20)
- Parent query created for first while loop, to retrieve all the statements that are directly and indirectly nested within the loop (21)
- Flipped the order of design entity query: i.e. look for parent of a child (22 - 24)
- Find parents that are of specific design entities (25 - 26)
=============================================
Testing Uses select clause (27-31)
=============================================
- select variable/constants used given statement number (27-28)
- select design entities that uses specific variable (29-31)
* it feels like Uses are mostly queries that uses two synonyms
=============================================
Testing Modifies select clause (32)
=============================================
- select all variables that are modified (32), this is done with "_", so all variables that are modified should be returned 
* UPDATE:the query 32 is actually semantically invalid according to Basic SPA requirements, page 21 
=============================================
TO BE ADDED: Invalid Queries for the 4 clauses
=============================================
======================================================================================
112: Two Synonym, One Clause - WIP
=========================================================================================================================
Testing Uses select clause (1-4)
=============================================
- tested some combinations of design entities (1-4)
=============================================
Testing Modifies select clause (5-9)
=============================================
- tested some combinations of design entities (5-9)
- TODO: need a wider variety of SIMPLE Source to test the queries
=============================================
Testing Parent and Parent* select clause (10-11)
=============================================
- tested basic case of parent and parent* (10-11)
=============================================
Testing Follows and Follows* select clause (12-14)
=============================================
- tested basic case of follows and follows* (12-14)
=========================================================================================================================
20: A more complex SIMPLE Source; with multiple procedures, call statements and others
=========================================================================================================================
