source patterns which would influence Affects evaluation

while stmt: possible for param 1 to come after param 2, i.e. Affects(35,25), possible for both param to be the same assignment stmt, i.e. Affects(2,2)?

if stmt: e.g. param 1 from if then stmtLst, param 2 from if else stmtLst results in no flow between them

if nested in while: by nesting if in while, we create a flow between if then stmtLst and if else stmtLst

while nested in if: no impact, akin to testing while and if separately



========

Emphasis on various source to increase coverage of affects/affects*
most basic tests are boolean > more easily verified, less human errors

tuple results for multiple clauses
