1 - Select all program lines that can be executed immediately after another program line
prog_line n1,n2;
Select n2 such that Next*(n1,n2)
2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
5000
2 - test individual program lines from 1 to 5 // CFG after 5 is similar to line 2 to 5
prog_line n;
Select n such that Next*(1,n)
2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
5000
3 - test Next* using first while loop as start point
prog_line n;
Select n such that Next*(2,n)
2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
5000
4 - test Next* using second while loop (one level nesting) as start point
prog_line n;
Select n such that Next*(5,n)
2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
5000
5 - test Next* using third while loop (three level nesting) as start point
prog_line n;
Select n such that Next*(8,n)
2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
5000
