Basic Arithmetic Expressions plays around with the number of operands and operators.

5 operators:
+ - * / %


Tier 1: 2 operands, 1 operator
Tier 2: 3 operands, 2 operators
Tier 3: 4 operands, 3 operators


All expressions are valid, however some results are invalid. 

Invalid results includes: 
- negative values
- float values

This is because INTEGER Lexcial tokens in SIMPLE only account for positive integers.
